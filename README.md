# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code 🧑‍💻
I have started re-learning Machine Learning and will be updating this repository with my progress. My focus is on exploring and learning new concepts in Machine Learning. Recently, I have been working on research papers related to Supervised Contrastive Learning from 'Arxiv' (February to June). Currently, I am diving into MATLAB and its various tools to enhance my skills.

This README file will serve as a record of my learning journey and help me track my progress 📈.

**Current Learning Status:** PyTorch and Replicating Research papers
