# 100-Days-Of-ML-Code

Started re-learning ML (After discontinuing it) whenever I learn something new in Machine Learning, This Repository will be updated. Right now, I forked an open source project and working on it for the past one month (March - April 2023). 

This readme file will help me keep track of my learning progress.

**Current Learning Status:** Finished learning, how to build a deep learning model using pre-trained model using TensorFlow.
